# pterodactyl-tor
Pterodactyl egg to install a tor node.

After creating the server, you should check the TOR Project pages on how to configure the node.
https://community.torproject.org/relay/

This egg gives a minimal configuration, which probably isn't secure.

# By running a Tor relay, you can help make the Tor network:
- faster (and therefore more usable)
- more robust against attacks
- more stable in case of outages
- safer for its users (spying on more relays is harder than on a few)
